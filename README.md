# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-Model

###
1) Developed a predictive model for Airbnb rental prices using New York City Airbnb data with 48,000+ listings.
2) Engineered 10+ key features, including location, room type, availability, and review scores, to enhance model accuracy.
3) Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and applying StandardScaler normalization.
4) Built and trained Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models.
5) Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn & Matplotlib, visualizing price distributions and outliers.
6) Improved model interpretability by performing feature selection and analyzing the impact of location on price variations.
7) Automated price prediction for new Airbnb listings, allowing hosts to estimate optimal pricing.
8) Achieved a 15% improvement in accuracy after hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
